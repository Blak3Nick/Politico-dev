    h1.indexpara#NAME Curt Nicholson
    p.indexpara#1 Curt Nicholson was born and raised in Mattoon, Illinois before moving to Kentuckiana in 2001. He and his wife, Rose, have enjoyed the privilege of living in Jeffersonville for the past twelve years. Curt graduated from Heritage Christian Academy (after a stellar senior basketball season) and married his high school sweetheart one month later. Curt and Rose have one son, Blake, who is married to Sara. Blake is currently serving in the United States Air Force, while Sara works in marketing. 
    p.indexpara#2 Following high school, Curt earned degrees in Theology and Religious Education and then served as an educator, coach, athletic director, and pastor. He has worked in the financial services industry for the past six years. Curt has seen growth in the private school he led, the church he pastored, and increased sales in his current position by applying the principles of liberty, common sense, and servant-leadership (which he learned from his Mom, wife, the teachings of Jesus, and his daily interactions with every-day people from all across the social spectrum). 
    p.indexpara#3 As your representative on the Clark County Council, Curt plans to bring responsible, accountable, and frugal governance to Clark County.
