He has worked in the financial services industry for the past six years. Curt has seen growth in the private school he led, the church he pastored, and increased sales in his current position by applying the principles of liberty, common sense, and servant-leadership (which he learned from his Mom, wife, the teachings of Jesus, and his daily interactions with every-day people from all across the social spectrum).
